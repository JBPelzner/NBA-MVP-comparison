This project is a visual story told with NBA players' statistics that investigates who the most valuable "Most Valuable Player" was out of the NBA's 2013 to 2018 seasons. The first 4 pages explain how we selected the best player of the cohort, and the last 4 pages show some statistics that explain what makes him stand out even among the best of the best.

Isaac created the visualizations titled "MVP Basics" through "The Real MVP," and Julian created "ABCD" through "EFGH."
